# Tenant Usage Grid UI

A small deployable TypeScript UI that provides an editable grid for:

- Tenant ID
- Branch Name
- Usage
- URL list
- OMS Firm
- GIO Firm
- Note
- Status with color icon (`Read`, `WIP`, `Unset`, `Expire`)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

The production assets are generated into `dist/` and can be deployed to any static hosting service.
